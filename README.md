## NS3-simulation_of_IoT-Edge
NS3 simulation of a real-time IoT-Edge vision system
● Examined the WiFi network latency associated with an IoT-Edge computing infrastructure for distributed real-time video analytics.\
● The novel Edge computing infrastructure enables real-time Deep Learning video analytics by performing object detection/classification, feature extraction, local and global re-identification across many cameras. \
● Simulated the IoT-Edge vision system including IoT-camera nodes and edge servers using NS3 discrete event network simulator. \
● Constructed a configurable network topology including WiFi STA and CSMA nodes and access points that use 802.11ac standard and supports multiple spatial streams. \
● Analysed the throughput and node to server delay of the packet transmission for three different task mapping and resource allocation configurations of the Edge vision system.
